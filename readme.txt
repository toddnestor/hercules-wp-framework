== Installation ==

Add this plugin by uploading the zip using the "Add Plugin" feature built into Wordpress.  Otherwise manaully unzip the folder
and upload the entire directory to your blog's plugins folder ( /wp-content/plugins/ ).

Activating the plugin is option, the other plugins that rely on it look for the code, so it doesn't actually have to be activated.
